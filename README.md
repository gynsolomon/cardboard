This is my diary of making a copy of Google's Cardboard VR Suit. Construct a VR viewer from everyday items you can find in your garage, online or at your local hardware store.

Here's what you need to get started:

Shopping List (www.taobao.com -- The biggest online store of China)

Corrugated cardboard sheet, preferably E Flute (corrugated cardboard comes in a variety of thicknesses called "flutes"), available at many art supply stores and online . For best results, you should look for strong, thin cardboard (sturdy shoe box rather than moving box). Minimum size: 8.75in (22cm) by 22in (56cm), and 0.06in (1.5mm) thickness. Online sources here and here


2.Lenses

This is the trickiest component. Lenses that have a 45mm focal distance might work. Biconvex lenses work best because they prevent distortion around the edges. We used the Durovis OpenDive Lens Kit available here (US) and here (EU).


3.Magnets
